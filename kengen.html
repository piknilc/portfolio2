<a href="portfolio2.html"><img src="images/z.png" alt=""></a>       
   <h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>

<h4> 1.1 Objectives Of Industrial Attachment</h4>
<p>1.To apply the concepts and school-based skills into practice<br>
2. To understand the environment of working and functional relationships within the organization</p>

<h4>1.2 Overview</h4>
<p>Kenya Electricity Generating company PLC (KenGen) is the leading electric power in East Africa.
     It’s the largest electric power producer in Kenya generating over 
     65% of the electricity consumed in kenya.<br> KenGen was incorporated in 1994 under 
     the Kenyan Companies Act as Kenya Power Company (KPC) with mandate to generate
      electricity through the development, management and operation of power plants.
       <br>The shareholders of the company later contracted East Africa Power and lighting
        company (EAP and L) to manage KPC.In 1983, EAP and L changed to Kenya Power and lighting company.</p>

<h4>1.3 Location</h4>
<p>Olkaria Geothermal project is situated within Hell's Gate National Park 120km 
    from Nairobi and neighbors horticultural farms that produce some of the nicest 
    flowers in the world. The project is also adjacent to lake Naivasha, which is a
     fresh water lake in the Kenya Rift-Valley and Ramsar Site.</p>
<h4>1.4 KenGen mission statement </h4>
<p>To efficiently generate competitively priced electric energy using state of 
    art technology, skilled and motivated human resource to ensure financial success.</p>
    <h4>1.5 Vision statement </h4>
<p>To be the market leader in the provision of reliable, safe, quality and competitively priced 
    electric energy in the eastern Africa region.</p>
    <h3> Geothermal phenomenon</h3>
<p>Geothermal energy is the natural heat sourced within the earth’s crust. The energy is manifested on the earth’s surface 
in the form of fumaroles, hot springs and hot altered grounds. To extract this energy, wells are drilled to tap steam
 and water at high temperatures (250-350Oc) and pressures (600-1200PSI) at depths of 1-3KM. For electricity generation, 
 the steams are piped to a turbine which rotates a generator to produce electrical energy.</p>


<h3> Geothermal development in Kenya</h3>
<p>Exploration for geothermal resources in Kenya started in 1950’s and gained momentum in the 1960’s where two wells were drilled at Olkaria.
From 1967, the United Nations development programme (UNDP) in collaboration with the Kenyan government and 
then East African Power and Lighting Company, conducted geological and geophysical surveys in the area between 
lake Bogoria and Olkaria. The studies identified Olkaria as the most prospective area leading the construction of
 the first geothermal power station between 1981 and 1984.</p>

<h3>Olkaria geothermal system</h3>
<p>The heat source of the geothermal system at Olkaria is due to due to intrusion of magma bodies to depths of less 
than 6KM from the surface. Parts of the magma of the magma extruded to the surface to the numerous hills and dome
 that dot the Olkaria landscape. The ololbutot lava erupted about 200 years ago attesting to the useful volcanic activity at Olkaria.
The geothermal system consists of a two-phase reservoir that is hosted within 0.9-1.65-million-year-old fractured 
trachyte and rhyolite rocks at depths of between 600M and 3000M. At the Olkaria east, Olkaria domes field and Olkaria 
north east geothermal fields, wells with nominal diameter of 8 inches are drilled into the reservoir and the upper
 700-1200 cased off to avoid cold fluid inflow into the bore. The wells provide 75% water and 25% steam. Separation 
 of steam is done using cyclone separators from where dry steam is piped to the powerhouse and separated water injected back into reservoir.

<h4> 1.GENERATION OF GEOTHERMAL POWER PROCESS</h4>

<h5>Components of geothermal power plant</h5>
      <img src="images/x2.jpg" alt="">
   <h6> a. Separator </h6>
To combat damage to the turbines, plants install separators-the most important components at a geothermal plant.
 Separators ensure only clean, dry steam enters the turbine. There are two common separator designs-the vertical 
 cyclone and horizontal separator
 <b>How separator works</b>
The cyclonic or centrifugal type separator uses a series of fins to generate high-speed cyclonic flow. The velocity 
of the steam causes it to swirl around the body of the separator, throwing the heavier, suspended water to the wall 
where it drains down to a steam trap installed under the unit.
<h6>b. Cooling tower</h6>
Cooling tower is an integrated part of any geothermal power plant because waste heat from turbine exhaust steam must be 
continuously rejected to make the plants operate. According to heat dump choice, the cooling system can be classified as
 wet cooling and dry cooling.
<b>Functions of cooling tower </b>
Cooling water cools the warm water discharged from the condenser and feed the cooled water back to the condenser. Cooling 
towers are used for large size power stations specially in water shortage areas.
<h6>c. Gas removal system</h6>
Non-condensable gases such as Sulphur oxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen are gaseous 
emissions that are found dissolved in geothermal water. Above are gases that do not condense into a liquid within the operating 
temperatures of the refrigeration system.
<h6> d. Turbine Generator</h6>
In a turbine generator, a moving fluid-water, steam, combustion gases, or air pushes a series of blade mounted on a rotor shaft.
 The force of the fluid on the blade’s spins/rotates the rotor shaft of a generator. The generator in turn converts mechanical energy 
 (kinetic) of the rotor to electrical energy.

 <img src="images/x3.jpg" alt="">
    Stator winding 
    The stator winding is fitted with a three-phase winding. A rectifier is used to convert the power from alternating to direct form.
     A regulator is used to control the field current so that the output voltage of the alternator-rectifier is properly matched to the
      battery voltage as the speed of the engine varies.
    
      <img src="images/x4.jpg" alt="">
    Rotors
Rotors are the moving part in an alternator that have permanent magnets that move around the stators iron plates to generate an 
alternating current (AC). Rotors require existing motion to function, so only once the engine or turbine is already running will a rotor
 work with a stator to provide a charge.

 <img src="images/x5.jpg" alt="">

    <img src="images/x7.jpg" alt="">
    Generator exciter
Exciter or DC relay is a device which forces the DC machine-held excitation to build up during starting or which functions when the
 machine voltage has built up to a given value.
Excitation creates the electromagnetic field to make this mechanical to electrical conversion occur. The type of excitation system 
used in Olkaria geothermal power plants is a brushless excitation system. This is an inside- out AC generator that delivers its AC
voltage to the rotor of the main generator, and receives its excitation from the stator of the same generator.

<img src="images/x8.jpg" alt="">
    Automatic voltage regulator
An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is an electronic device that maintains a constant voltage level to electrical equipment on the same load.
 The AVR regulates voltage variations to deliver constant, reliable power supply.
PMG 
The PMG (permanent magnet generator) is a system which is used for secondary exciting. The PMG provides stable and reliable electric energy
 for AVR regardless of the generators terminal voltage. The generator with PMG excitation system can provide 300% rated current during 
 short-circuit, which occurs for 5-10 seconds.



<h4>2. SWITCH GEAR ROOM</h4>
Switch gear refers to wide range of switching devices that all serve the same purpose: controlling, safe guarding and isolating power systems.

<img src="images/x9.jpg" alt="">
    Types of switch gears

a.	Low voltage (LV) switch gear
Low voltage switch gear governs mediators among low voltage services and technology and human beings. Single main LV switch board is 
normally present which would be fed to a mains transformer
b.	Medium voltage (MV) switch gear.
MV switchgear is classed based on its purpose and insulating method. Voltage level, effective voltage, constant voltage tolerance 
voltage or impulse voltage are all parameters for MV switch gear panel
c.	High voltage (HV) switch gear.
High voltage switch gear is indeed a power system that deals with voltages more than 36kV. The arcing created during switching operations
 is likewise very high due to the high voltage level.
Components of switch gear room

a.	Circuit breakers
b.	Motor control center
c.	Relays
d.	Busbars
e.	Dcs 

<h5>RELAYS </h5>
1.latching relay-this is a two position electrically actuated switch that maintains either contact position indefinitely without
 any power being sent to. This allows electrician to control circuit by simply providing a single pulse to the relay control circuit.

 <img src="images/x10.jpg" alt="">
    2.Electromechanical relay-An electromechanical relay is a type of relay which function using a magnetic field produced by an 
    electromagnetic coil when a control signal is applied to it. It’s called as electromechanical since it has moving contacts in 
    the output circuit which are operated by applying an electrical signal. A type of electromechanical relay which I interacted
     with is Earth fault relay that can sense faults between phase and earth. Its main function is to operate for the leakage 
     currents to the earth.

<h5>CIRCUIT BREAKERS</h5>
During my training I interacted with various circuit breakers which include:
1. Air circuit breaker
2. Gas circuit breaker
3. Miniature circuit breaker
4. Vacuum circuit breaker
Air circuit breaker
An air circuit breaker (ACB) is an electrical device used to provide overcurrent and short circuit protection for 
electric circuits over 800 Amps to 10K Amps. These are usually used in low voltage applications below 450V. 
we can find those systems in distribution panels below 450V.

<img src="images/x12.jpg" alt="">
<img src="images/x13.jpg" alt="">
    Conducting IR test and timing test for air circuit breaker at Olkaria 2

Vacuum circuit breaker
This is a kind of circuit breaker where the arc quenching takes place in a vacuum medium. 
A vacuum circuit breaker is used to disconnect power in medium voltage range from 11kV to 33Kv. 
Once the breaker is opened within the contact vacuum, an arc can be generated by the contacts

<img src="images/x14.jpg" alt="">
<img src="images/x15.jpg" alt="">
    Gas circuit breaker.
Sulphur hexafluoride circuit breakers protect electrical power stations and distribution systems by interrupting electric currents, 
when tripped by a protective relay. Instead of oil, air, or vacuum, a Sulphur hexafluoride gas to cool and quench the arc on opening a circuit

<img src="images/x16.jpg" alt="">
    Miniature circuit breaker
Miniature circuit breaker is an electrical switch which automatically switches off the electrical circuit during an
 abnormal condition of the network means in overload condition as well as faulty condition.MCB is much sensitive to over current than a fuse.

 <img src="images/x17.jpg" alt="">
    Circuit breaker test
Circuit breaker testing  ( also known as ‘tripprofiling’) is used to test both the performance of individual 
 switching mechanisms and the timing of the overall tripping system. Circuit breaker testing is used to test both 
 the performance of individual switching mechanisms and the timing of the overall tripping system
Types of circuits breaker tests

a.	Contact resistance test
The main contacts and the primary stabs need to be checked periodically to detect abnormal wear, inadequate
 lubrication and loose pivot points inside the circuit breaker. This test should be calculated usinf low voltage , 
 direct current (DC) power supply ( low resistance ohmmeter) to pass current from line to load, with the circuit 
 breaker in the closed position.
b.	Insulation resistance tests
The circuit breaker insulation system is a critical area that requires testing and evaluation. Insulation systems
 can weaken due to the heat created by arc interruption, especially if they are not routinely maintained.
Weak insulation can result into catastrophic failure especially during arc interruption. The insulation resistance
 test is useful for detecting major defects in the insulation system, but it can also be used as final safety check 
 before returning the breaker to service.


<h5>MOTOR CONTROL CENTER</h5>
Motor control center is an assembly to control some or all electric motors in a central location. Due to
 industrial development, the requirement for the automation and mechanization of the different industrial 
 processes requires many motors, so in order to control the motors, MCC’s are required.
The MCC must protect the motor from;
	overcurrent
	overload
	low voltage
	phase failure
	phase reversal protection
	ground fault protection

 Components in a motor control centre.
	bus bar
	circuit breaker
	magnetic contactor
	relay control
	contactor auxiliary contactor
	control transformer
	cable installation control panel enclosure
	limit switch
<img src="images/x18.jpg" alt="">
    
    <h6> Bus bar </h6>
A bus bar is a bar that is made up of brass, copper etc, the major component of a bus bar is to provide 
or distribute the required power to the electrical equipment. In MCC, the busbar would act as a power distributor. 
The major advantage of using a bus bar in an MCC is that we can eliminate the wiring of several components, 
so because of this, the size of the MCC would be reduced and also the number of parts in it.
Overload relay
These relays would protect the motor from overheating, the overheating could be caused by the overload of
 the driven machinery. It can also be caused due to the low voltage level or if there is an open phase in
  a three-phase system. So, when the excessive current id drawn from a specified amount of time, the overload
   relay would open and the motor will be disconnected from the power source.
Control transformers 
This is used to decrease voltage level. Sometimes it’s necessary to operate the control circuit at low voltages than the power circuit.
Magnetic contactors
Magnetic contactor is used in an MCC to start or stop a motor. Mostly, there would be a remote-control device to
 start and stop the motor and for this purpose, we can use a contactor. The operation of a contactor is based on
  the electromagnetic principle.
Time delay relay
The major purpose of a time delay relay is to provide the on delay and off delay timing. So, this device can be 
used for the automatic time setting, this device can be combined with the other control equipment in an MCC, like a magnetic contactor.

<h6>Miniature circuit breaker</h6>
The purpose of MCB is to disconnect a circuit incase if there is an excessive current flow in the circuit,
 or in case if there is an electrical load that exceeds capacity.
Major purpose of MCC

<h6>Motor starting</h6>
    Motor starting is an important process, and the starting of motor should be slow and gradual and this 
    would be useful to protect a machine. Some industrial machines could be damaged if its operated very 
    fast initially instead of gradually increasing the speed of a machine
<h6>Operational control </h6>
This device should maintain the required operational speeds and characteristics. So, by maintaining or
 controlling the operational speed it can protect the motor, machine, materials and operator
<h6>Stopping </h6>
The MCC must be capable to provide the fast stopping of the motor because in certain cases the machine must 
be stopped quickly and this should be achieved by the MCC. Emergency stops must be carried out for certain industrial machinery.
<h6>Reversing </h6>
The direction of the machine rotation would be required to change in an industrial process and this should 
be done easily. In certain case, continuous changing of direction is required in an industrial process.


<h6>Damage prevention<h6>
The machine should be protected from any damages because it could cost a lot. An example of this would be 
preventing the pileups in a conveyor by a machine. So, the machine must do the necessary actions such as
 reverse, stop slow. The MCC must control the machine according to functionality.
<h6>DCS (Distributed control system)</h6>
A distributed control system is a digital automated industrial control system (ICS) that uses geographically
 distributed loops throughout a factory, machine or control area.

<h6>Components of DCS</h6>

•	PLC
•	HMI
•	RTU

<img src="images/x19.jpg" alt="">
    <b> •	PLC (programmable logic controllers)</b>
A programmable logic controller (PLC) is an industrial computer control system that continuously monitors 
the state of input devices and makes decisions based upon a custom program to control the state of output devices.
<b>•	HMI (human machine interface)</b>
A human machine interface (HMI) is a user interface or dashboard that connects a person to a machine, 
system or device. The term can technically be applied to any screen that allows a user to interact with a device,
 HMI is commonly used in context of industrial process
 <b>•	RTU (remote terminal unit)</b>
A remote terminal unit is a microprocessor controlled electronic device that interfaces objects in the physical 
world to a distributed control system or SCADA system by transmitting elementary data toa a master system, and by
 using messages from the master supervisory system to control connected objects.

 <h4>3. MOTORS </h4>
A motor is an electromechanical device which converts electrical power to mechanical power.
All motors I interacted with during the training process were induction motors
An induction motor or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed
 to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding. 
 An induction motor can therefore be made without electrical connections to the rotor.
A three phase induction motors are used in Olkaria power plants. A three-phase induction motor converts 3 
phase input electrical power into output mechanical power. A three-phase induction motor consists of a stator and a rotor.
Motor connections techniques

<img src="images/x20.jpg" alt="">
    Star connection
In star connection, the same ends of the three coils are connected to create a neutral point.
Star connection is used only when we require less power and it would only give low power compared to 
delta connection because the three terminals are shorted and it would become neutral. When starting a motor,
 windings are connected in star configuration and this reduces the voltage across each winding 3. This also
  reduces the torque by a factor of three.
Delta connection
In delta windings, each winding receives 415 volts. After motor is started in star connection, after a period
 of time the winding are reconfigured as delta and the motor runs normally. In delta connection high torque is produced.

 <h4>4. TRANSFORMERS</h4>
</h5>Types of transformers used in a geothermal power plant</h5>
a.	Generator transformer (GT)
b.	Unit transformer (UT)
c.	Auxiliary transformer (AT)
d.	Voltage transformer (VT)
e.	Current transformer (Ct)

<h6> a.	Generator transformer</h6>
Generator transformer is the largest transformer on a power station and connects the generator output to the grid.

<h6>b.	Unit transformer</h6>
Unit transformer means the transformers through which the generated voltage is transformed to grid voltage (132 Kv)
 used for evacuation of power to the national grid. Its function is to deliver the power to the motor, fans, pumps, 
 lighting etc.
 <h6>c.	Auxiliary transformer </h6>
Auxiliary transformers are used for lighting purposes, heating the train wagons or for the safety systems supply or
 the substations own supply.

 <img src="images/x21.jpg" alt="">
    <h6> d.	Current transformer</h6>
A current transformer is a type of transformer that is used to reduce or multiply an alternating current. It produces
 a current on its secondary which is proportional to the current in its primary. Current transformers are an instrument transformer.

<h6>e.	Voltage transformer</h6>
Voltage transformers (VT) also called potential transformers are parallel connected type of instrument transformer. 
They are designed to present a negligible load to the supply being measured and have an accurate voltage ratio and 
phase relationship to enable accurate secondary connected wiring.
</h5>METHODS OF TESTING TRANSFORMERS</h5>
Testing transformers is more important than many people realize, and whenever CT or VT test is conducted, it’s important
 to ensure the technicians use the correct transformer testing equipment to ensure that all electrical, mechanical, 
 and thermal standards are being met.
 <h6>i.	Turns ratio testing.</h6>
Turns ratio transformer testing is commonly used to ensure that the winding ratio between the primary and secondary 
coils are aligned to recommended specifications. Theis type of transformer testing also ensures the transformer will
 provide either step up or step down, for instance, compromised of 100 primary turns and 10 secondary turns will work
  to reduce the voltage by factor of 10.
  <h6>Insulation resistance testing</h6>
Insulation resistance transformer testing also known as megger test, is used to determine the quality of transformer 
insulation within itself. These tests are conducted with a megohmmeter, one of the transformer test instruments, that 
operates similar to multi-meter. In order to pass the test, the insulation of a transformer must be determined to have a
greater resistance the defined by international standard for that transformer type.
<h6></h6>Power factor testing</h6>
Power factor transformer testing is the process wherein the power loss of the insulation systems is tested by measuring 
the angel the resulting current of power that occurs when AC voltage is applied. For the test result to be optimal, 
the angle of the current should measure 90o;
The test is completed with a power factor test kit, and its can be completely regularly throughout the life of the entire transformer.
<h6>Resistance testing</h6>
This type of transformer testing once a transformer has been left to settle at the same temperature of the surrounding air.
 The reason for this is to check for any differences between the opens and windings within the transformer. 
 This helps to ensure that all the circuits are still wired and connected correctly. This test is conducted using an ohmmeter.
a.	Load or copper losses test
b.	Temperature rise test
c.	Partial discharge test
d.	Frequency response analysis test
e.	Transformer oil breakdown test

<h4>5.GRID (electrical substation) </h4>

usage which are measurable. The transformers are also used for actuation of AC protective relay through supporting voltage and current.
Current transformer
A current transformer is a gadget utilized for the transformation of higher value currents into lower values. It is utilized in
an analogous manner to that of AC instruments, control apparatus and meters.
Voltage transformer 
The potential transformers are similar in characteristics as current transformers but are utilized for converting high voltages
 to lower voltages for protection of relay system and for lower rating metering of voltage measurements.
Conductors 
Conductors are the materials which permit flow of electrons through it. The best conductors are copper and aluminum.
 The conductors are utilized for transmission of energy from place to place over substations.
 <img src="images/x22.jpg" alt="">
    
    Insulators 
The insulators are materials which do not permit flow of electrons through it. Insulators resisting electric property. 
There are numerous types of insulators such as shackle, strain type, suspension type and stray type. 
Insulators are used in substations for avoiding contact with human or short circuit.

<img src="images/x23.jpg" alt="">
    Isolators 
The isolators in substations are mechanical switches which are deployed for isolation of circuits when there is an interruption of current.
These are known with the name of disconnected switches operation under no-load conditions and are not fortified with arc quenching devices.
<img src="images/x24.jpg" alt="">
    Busbars 
The busbar is among the most important elements of the substation and is a conductor which carries current to a point having
 numerous connections with it. The busbar is a kind of electrical junction which has outgoing and incoming currents paths. 
 Whenever a fault occurs in the busbar, entire connected to that specific section should be tripped for giving thorough isolation 
 in a small time to avoid danger rising due to conductor’s heat
Lighting arrestors 
Lightning arrestors can be considered as the first ever components of a substation. These are having a function of protecting 
equipment of substation from high voltages and also limiting the amplitude and duration of the currents flow.

<img src="images/x25.jpg" alt="">
    
    Circuit breakers
The circuit breakers are such types of switches utilized for closing or opening circuits at the time when a fault occurs within
 the system. When any fault occurs in the system, a relay is sending the tripped command to the circuit breaker which moves the
  contacts apart hence avoiding any damage to the circuitry.
  <img src="images/x26.jpg" alt="">
   
    Relays 
Relays are dedicated component of electrical substation equipment for the protection of system against abnormal situations e.g., faults.
 Relays are basically sensing gadgets which are devoted for sensing faults and are determining units’ location as well as sending 
 interruption message of tripped command to the specific point of the circuit.
Capacitor banks
Capacitor bank is defined as a set of numerous identical capacitors which are connected in either parallel or series inside an
 enclosure and are utilized for the correction of power factor as well as protections of circuitry of the substation.
  The use of capacitor banks is an economical technique for power factor maintenance and for correction problems related to power lag.

<img src="images/x27.jpg" alt="">
Switch yard 
The switch yards, switches, circuit breakers and transformers for the connection and disconnection of the transformers and 
circuit breakers. These are also having lighting arrestors to protect the substation or power station from strokes of natural lighting.
